# DATA-PROJECT-2

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to:
- Analyze loan application data  
- Build predictive models to determine loan approval status  
- Compare model performance and select the best-performing approach  

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Microsoft Word (for reporting)

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying patterns and insights using visualizations.
3. **Modeling** – Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.
4. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

## Results

- The best model achieved **X% accuracy** with balanced performance across classes.
- Insights from the model can assist in streamlining the loan approval process.
